# React Router v6 useParams Hook Issue in Conditionally Rendered Component

This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router v6 where the `useParams` hook fails to update correctly when used within a conditionally rendered component.  The issue arises when the component is initially unmounted and later mounted; `useParams` doesn't reflect the updated URL parameters.

## Bug Description
The `useParams` hook in React Router v6 does not automatically re-read parameters when a component mounts after being initially unmounted. This leads to stale parameter values within the conditionally rendered component, resulting in unexpected behavior or incorrect data display.

## Solution
The solution involves using the `useEffect` hook to check for changes in the URL parameters. By using `useLocation` to monitor the URL, this ensures that when the component mounts (or re-mounts), the correct parameters are immediately accessed, resolving the staleness problem.
