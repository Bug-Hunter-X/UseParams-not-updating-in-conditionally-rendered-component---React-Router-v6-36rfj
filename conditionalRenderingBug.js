In React Router Dom v6, if you are using `useParams` hook inside a component that is rendered conditionally, you might encounter an unexpected behavior. If the component is initially not rendered (i.e., a condition is false), and later becomes visible (condition becomes true), `useParams` might not update correctly. It will retain its initial value, which is likely empty, until the page reloads or there is a full re-render. This issue occurs because `useParams` relies on the URL and does not automatically re-read the parameters when the component mounts.
